# Game-Organizer-Project

Welcome to to Game Organizer Project. This is a site that uses the RAWG.io API and database to organize and display information about games. 

## Functionality
The home page of the site sorts the games it gets by highest rating to start, with 10 items per page
The main page displays the games in the database sorted by either rating or alphabetical order and filtered by genre, platforms, and tags specified in the menu on the left side of the page.
Each card displays a cover image, rating, the name, and tags for a game and clicking on it takes you to the details page for it where the description, platforms, rating, and release date are displayed.
